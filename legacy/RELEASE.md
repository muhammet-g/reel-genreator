# Before the community receives it

Public home since 2026-09-22, on the owner's explicit instruction: https://github.com/ebraheembinessa-E-vias/community-reels-engine (public, CC0). The release ZIP: https://github.com/ebraheembinessa-E-vias/community-reels-engine/releases/latest/download/community-reels-engine.zip. The steps below were followed before the first publication; repeat 4 and 5 before every update, and publish only on the owner's word (7).

2026-09-23: the Arabic edition of the manual added (output/pdf/community-reels-guide-ar.pdf), on the owner's approval.

1. Owner tests the demo and one complete spoken recording: Gemini analysis, corrected clean cut, approval, visual pass, audible final output.
2. Recheck current API model availability/rates and dependency licenses. Model availability and provider terms can change.
3. Preserve the accurate origin notice: E.B.E - powered by E-VIAS. Original materials use CC0 1.0, as requested by the owner. Use, modification, redistribution and resale are allowed; attribution is voluntary. Third-party terms remain separate. Do not add restrictions on the owner's behalf.
4. Run `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, then `python3 scripts/package.py`.
5. Inspect the archive inventory. It must exclude `.env`, every creator recording, private analysis, generated projects, work folders, node_modules and machine-specific paths. The PDF, assistant-readable manual, first-message card, author notice and CC0 text must be present.
6. Give a fresh copy to one community member. Record their operating system, install friction, successful sample output and questions. Do not claim support for a platform until that path works.
7. Publish to the owner's chosen repository only after their explicit publication instruction. The tool does not push, deploy or post.

The local sample demonstrates template rendering and audio preservation. It cannot by itself prove Arabic transcription quality, edit judgement or audience results.
